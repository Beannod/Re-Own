<!-- Consolidated: Mobile app README content removed. Refer to root README.md for project-wide documentation. -->
This file intentionally minimal. All canonical documentation lives in the root `README.md` and architecture docs under `docs/architecture/`.

Mobile-specific setup will be merged into root docs in a future update.
